Performance Comparison of Swift http-parser port
================================================

Source Repository is:

  git@github.com:helje5/HTTPParser.git

Swift port was branched of C http-parser Version 2.6.0, git hash:

  bee4817ebea0eaa592143c7825f5c96f040c84e4

Swift port version this started from:

  d3912dd40b4c2db9d23932649404e6e58f7ba013


### Port Specific Notes

The port has NOT been optimized for speed at all.

- macros have been replaced with func's
  - so the compiler has to be smart to inline them
  - the C macros have been accessing local state, to simulate that
    I used nested functions
- the big goto loop has been replaced with a step function,
- there are a few dispatch tables which are converted straight to Swift arrays,
  such are range-checked etc
- callbacks are done using regular Swift closures

C Version - Release Build:

    [0] time: 97ms
    [1] time: 97ms
    [2] time: 101ms
    [3] time: 97ms
    [4] time: 98ms

Swift 2.2 - Release Build, safety checks off (doesn't matter)

    [0] time: 890ms
    [1] time: 881ms
    [2] time: 880ms
    [3] time: 885ms

Swift 3 2016-05-31

    [0] time: 910ms
    [1] time: 897ms

#### Instruments Says

- lots of ARC killing perf

### struct-parser branch

Swift 2.2

[0] time: 886ms
[1] time: 880ms
[2] time: 879ms
[3] time: 876ms
[4] time: 889ms
-----
Total: 4410ms COUNT: 20

Improv not measurable, but then we allocate the parser object just once.
